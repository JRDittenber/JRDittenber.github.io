            <li>Define the concept of the limit of a function and compute limits using various techniques.</li>
            <li>Define continuity of a function and apply the definition to determine continuity of a function.</li>
            <li>Define the concept of the derivative of a function and use the definition to compute derivatives.</li>
            <li>Use the limit of the slope of a secant line of a function to define the slope of the tangent line of a function.</li>
            <li>Find derivatives of various functions, including powers of a variable, polynomials, products, quotients, trigonometric functions and their inverses, composite functions, exponential functions, logarithmic functions, and implicitly defined functions.</li>
            <li>Determine the equation of the tangent and normal lines to a function at a point.</li>
            <li>Use facts about the first and second derivative of a function to more accurately sketch the graph of the function.</li>
            <li>Understand and apply the Mean Value Theorem.</li>
            <li>Solve related rate and maximum/minimum word problems.</li>
